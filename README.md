# Java Coffee Shop

This application is an intentional vulnerable Java Spring-Boot application with Thymeleaf.
It is use for training purposes only!

The code is and layout of the application is originally based on https://github.com/hieutdo/waa-coffee-shop, and a workshop created by [Brian Vermeer](https://brianvermeer.nl).
However it is heavily edited, updated and includes security problems by design!
